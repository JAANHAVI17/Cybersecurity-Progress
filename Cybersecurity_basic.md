## ðŸ”¹ About
This repo contains short, easy-to-remember notes on fundamental cybersecurity topics â€” great for quick revision, classroom assignments, or beginner study.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why it Matters
- Prevents data breaches and financial loss  
- Protects personal and organizational information  
- Ensures digital safety and privacy  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts
1. **Threats** â†’ Hackers, malware, phishing, DDoS  
2. **Vulnerabilities** â†’ Weak passwords, outdated software, misconfiguration  
3. **Defense Mechanisms** â†’ Firewalls, encryption, multi-factor authentication  
4. **Cybersecurity Domains** â†’ Network, application, information security  
5. **Antivirus** â†’ A program that detects, removes, and prevents malicious software

## ðŸ”¹ Definitions
- **Data Breach** â†’ A security incident where unauthorized people access sensitive information.  
- **Malware** â†’ Software designed to damage, destroy, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.  
- **Phishing** â†’ Fraud that tricks people into sharing sensitive data (e.g., passwords) by pretending to be a trusted entity.  
- **Ransomware** â†’ A type of malware that locks or steals data and demands payment (ransom) to restore access.  
- **Firewall** â†’ A network device or software that filters traffic and blocks unauthorized access.  
- **Encryption** â†’ Transforming information into a code so only authorized people can read it.  
- **Antivirus** â†’ A program that detects, removes, and protects against malicious software.

## ðŸ”¹ Threats & Vulnerabilities
**Common Threats**
- Hackers (unauthorized access)  
- Malware (viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware)  
- Phishing (social engineering emails/websites)  
- DDoS (service disruption by flooding)  

**Common Vulnerabilities**
- Weak or reused passwords  
- Outdated or unpatched software  
- Default configurations left unchanged  
- Misconfigured network services  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Defense Mechanisms
- **Firewall** â†’ Block or restrict unwanted traffic  
- **Encryption** â†’ Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit  
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** â†’ Requires more than a password to log in  
- **Antivirus / EDR** â†’ Detect and remove malware  
- **Patch Management** â†’ Keep software updated to remove vulnerabilities  
- **Least Privilege** â†’ Give users only the access they need  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Domains of Cybersecurity
- **Network Security** â†’ Securing networks, routers, switches, and traffic  
- **Application Security** â†’ Protecting apps from bugs and attacks (e.g., input validation)  
- **Information Security** â†’ Protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- **Endpoint Security** â†’ Securing individual devices (PCs, mobiles)  
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** â†’ Managing users and permissions
