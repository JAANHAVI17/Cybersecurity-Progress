# Networking Basics - TryHackMe

## 🌍 What I Learned  

### 1. What is Networking?  
- Networking is basically how computers talk to each other.  
- I learned that computers connect and exchange data using a set of rules called **protocols**.  
- Example: When I open Google, my laptop is sending a request to Google’s servers through the network.  

---

### 2. IP Addresses  
- Every device on a network has a **unique identity** called an IP address.  
- Two versions exist:
  - **IPv4**: looks like `192.168.1.1`  
  - **IPv6**: looks like `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334` (longer and supports more devices).  

---

### 3. Packets  
- Data doesn’t travel all at once; it’s broken into **packets**.  
- Each packet contains the **source IP, destination IP, and data**.  
- It’s like sending a letter with an address written on it.  

---

### 4. Protocols  
- Protocols are the rules of communication.  
- I learned about:  
  - **HTTP/HTTPS** – web browsing  
  - **FTP** – file transfer  
  - **DNS** – converts domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses  
  - **TCP/UDP** – transport layer protocols  

---

### 5. OSI Model (High-Level)  
- A framework that explains how data moves through a network.  
- The 7 layers are:  
  1. Physical  
  2. Data Link  
  3. Network  
  4. Transport  
  5. Session  
  6. Presentation  
  7. Application  
- I don’t need to memorize everything yet, but I understood how each layer has a specific role.  

---

### 6. Common Ports  
- Services run on **ports**.  
- Examples:  
  - `80` → HTTP  
  - `443` → HTTPS  
  - `21` → FTP  
  - `22` → SSH

## 📌 Summary
From this module and my college lectures, I learned that **networking is the backbone of cybersecurity**. Without understanding how devices talk to each other, it’s impossible to secure them.  

This was my **first big step** in connecting my college fundamentals with practical security learning.

---

### 🚀 My Takeaway  
Networking is the **foundation of cybersecurity**. Before hacking or defending, I need to know how computers talk to each other. This module helped me understand the basics clearly.
