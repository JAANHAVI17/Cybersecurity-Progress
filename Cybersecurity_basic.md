## Cybersecurity Basics — In Detail

---

### What is Cybersecurity  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. These threats include hacking, malware, unauthorized access, data breach, ransomware, etc.

---

### Why Cybersecurity is Important? 
- It helps **prevent data breaches** and financial loss.  
- It protects personal as well as organizational information.  
- It ensures digital safety and privacy for individuals and businesses.

### Key Concepts  

| Concept             | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Threats             | Entities or actions that can cause damage: hackers, malware, phishing, DDoS |
| Vulnerabilities     | Weak spots attackers exploit: weak passwords, outdated software, misconfigurations |
| Defense Mechanisms  | Tools & strategies to mitigate threats: firewalls, encryption, MFA, antivirus |
| Cybersecurity Domains | Areas covered: network security, application security, information security, endpoint security, identity & access management |
| Antivirus           | Software that detects, removes, and prevents malware and other malicious programs |

### Definitions  

| Term         | Definition                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Breach   | A security incident where unauthorized people access sensitive information. |
| Malware       | Software designed to damage, destroy, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. |
| Phishing      | Fraud that tricks someone into giving sensitive data (e.g. passwords) by pretending to be a trusted entity. |
| Ransomware    | A type of malware that locks or steals data and demands a ransom to restore access. |
| Firewall      | A device or software that filters traffic and blocks unauthorized access.     |
| Encryption    | Transforming information into a code so only authorized persons can read it.   |
| Antivirus     | A program to detect, remove, and protect against malicious software.          |

### Threats & Vulnerabilities  

- **Common Threats**  
  - Hackers: unauthorized access attempts  
  - Malware: viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware  
  - Phishing: social engineering emails or fake websites  
  - DDoS: overwhelming systems to disrupt service  

- **Common Vulnerabilities**  
  - Weak / reused passwords  
  - Outdated / unpatched software  
  - Default configurations left unchanged  
  - Misconfigured network services  

---

### Defense Mechanisms  

- Firewall — Blocks or restricts unwanted traffic.  
- Encryption — Protects data (in transit and at rest).  
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) — More than just password for login.  
- Antivirus / EDR — Detects and removes malware.  
- Patch Management — Keeps software updated so old vulnerabilities are fixed.  
- Least Privilege — Gives only necessary access to users and systems.  

---

### Domains in Cybersecurity  

- **Network Security** — Protecting routers, switches, network paths & traffic.  
- **Application Security** — Ensuring apps are secure against bugs, injections, etc.  
- **Information Security** — Keeping data private, correct, and accessible when needed.  
- **Endpoint Security** — Securing devices like PCs, mobiles, laptops.  
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** — Managing who can do what in the system.
