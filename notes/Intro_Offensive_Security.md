# Introduction to Offensive Security

When I started this room, I realized that hacking isn’t random or chaotic – it’s a **disciplined process** that ethical hackers follow to help organizations secure themselves.  

At first, “offensive” sounded negative, but here it means **attacking with permission** to make systems stronger. The goal is to **think like a hacker before the hacker does**.

## 🔹 What I Learned
- **Red Team** = the “good hackers” who simulate real attacks to test security.
- **Penetration Testing** = not destroying systems, but finding weak spots and reporting them.
- **The Hacker’s Workflow**:
  1. Reconnaissance → gathering info (open ports, versions, configs).
  2. Exploitation → actually breaking in using vulnerabilities.
  3. Post-Exploitation → escalating, moving deeper, leaving persistence.

## 🔹 My Reflection
Before this, I thought hacking = just breaking in. Now I know it’s a structured job, done to **help organizations**.  

This room gave me my first **hacker’s mindset**:  
*“If I were an attacker, how would I break this system?”*

✨ **Takeaway:** Offensive security is **organized attacking to defend better**.
