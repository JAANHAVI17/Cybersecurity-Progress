# Introduction to Defensive Security

This room gave me the opposite perspective. If offensive is about attacking, defensive is about **standing guard and protecting**.  

It felt like seeing the other side of a chessboard — attackers make moves, but defenders anticipate, block, and respond.

## 🔹 What I Learned
- **Blue Team** = defenders in SOCs, monitoring and responding 24/7.
- **Defense in Depth** = multiple layers of protection (firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM, antivirus).
- **Incident Response Plan**:
  1. Detect
  2. Contain
  3. Eradicate
  4. Recover
  5. Learn & Improve
- **Tools** like SIEM act like digital CCTV cameras — gathering logs, spotting anomalies, and alerting analysts.

## 🔹 My Reflection
Before this, I thought cybersecurity was only about “hacking in.”  
But I learned that defending systems is equally important — and it’s a **structured discipline** too.  

Defenders feel like **digital bodyguards**, protecting sensitive data and making sure even if attackers try, the damage is minimal.

✨ **Takeaway:** Defensive security is about **resilience and response** — surviving attacks, not just preventing them.
